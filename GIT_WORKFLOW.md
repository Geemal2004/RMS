```

### Before Pushing

```powershell
# Always pull latest changes first
git pull origin main

# Check what you're committing
git status
git diff

# Test locally before pushing
mvn clean install  # Backend
npm run build      # Frontend
```

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

```powershell
# If you encounter conflicts
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch
git merge main

# Fix conflicts in VS Code or IntelliJ
# Then:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin your-branch
```

### Daily Standup (Communication)

Each member should update team daily:

1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What will I work on today?
3. Any blockers?

---

## Emergency Procedures

### Accidentally Committed to Main

```powershell
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Undo commit, keep changes

git checkout -b feature/your-fix
git stash pop
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin feature/your-fix
```

### Lost Local Changes
