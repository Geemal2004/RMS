# 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE - Restaurant Stock Management System

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a LARGE project with 80+ files!

Due to the extensive nature of this full-stack application, I've created a structured approach for your team.

## 📋 What Has Been Generated

### ✅ COMPLETED (Already in your folder):

1. **Backend Core Structure**

   - `pom.xml` - Maven dependencies
   - `application.yml` - Configuration
   - Main Application class
   - All Entity models (User, Ingredient, Food, Sale, etc.)
   - All Repository interfaces
   - Security configuration
   - Custom UserDetailsService

2. **Documentation**

   - `README.md` - Complete project documentation
   - `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` - Detailed Git workflow for 3 members over 13 days
   - `CODE_PART1_DTOs_Services.md` - DTOs, Exceptions, and some Services

3. **.gitignore files** for both backend and frontend

---

## 🎯 TWO OPTIONS TO PROCEED

### **OPTION 1: Use Spring Initializr + Manual Coding (Recommended for Learning)**

This is the best option if your team wants to learn and understand the code.

#### Step 1: Generate Spring Boot Project

1. Go to https://start.spring.io/
2. Configure:

   - Project: Maven
   - Language: Java
   - Spring Boot: 3.2.0
   - Group: com.restaurant
   - Artifact: stock-management
   - Java: 17
   - Dependencies: Add these:
     - Spring Web
     - Spring Data JPA
     - Spring Security
     - MySQL Driver
     - Lombok
     - Validation
     - Spring Boot DevTools

3. Click "Generate" and extract to `C:\restaurant-stock-management\backend`

#### Step 2: Copy Generated Files

Copy all files from the current `backend` folder into the Spring Initializr generated project, **replacing/merging** files as needed.

#### Step 3: Complete Remaining Files

I'll generate the remaining files in manageable parts. Please confirm, and I'll create:

- Part 2: Remaining Services (Food, Sale, Alert, Analytics)
- Part 3: All Controllers
- Part 4: Advanced Features (Email, File Upload, Reports)
- Part 5: Complete Frontend React Application

---

### **OPTION 2: I'll Generate ALL Remaining Code (Faster)**

I can generate ALL remaining code files for you in structured documents that you can copy-paste. This includes:

1. **Backend (Remaining ~40 files)**:

   - FoodService, SaleService, AlertService
   - StockTransactionService, AnalyticsService
   - All Controllers (Auth, Ingredient, Food, Sale, etc.)
   - EmailService, FileStorageService, ReportService
   - Scheduled tasks, Caching configuration
   - Unit tests

2. **Frontend (~30 files)**:
   - Complete React application with Vite
   - Authentication context and services
   - All page components (Login, Dashboard, Ingredients, Foods, Sales, Analytics)
   - Reusable components
   - API integration
   - Routing and protected routes
   - CSS styling

---

## 🔥 RECOMMENDED APPROACH

I recommend **OPTION 2** because:

- You have only **13 days** (tight deadline!)
- Your team has **limited experience**
- The project has **many complex requirements**
- Copy-paste is faster and less error-prone for beginners

### Next Steps:

1. **Confirm which option** you want
2. I'll generate all remaining code in organized markdown files
3. Each file will have:
   - Exact file path
   - Complete code
   - Brief explanation
4. Your team follows the **GIT_WORKFLOW.md** day-by-day schedule

## 💡 What Your Team Should Do NOW

### All Members (Today):

1. **Install Required Software**:

   ```powershell
   # Check Java
   java -version  # Should be 17+

   # Check Maven
   mvn -version   # Should be 3.6+

   # Check Node.js
   node -version  # Should be 16+
   npm -version

   # Check MySQL
   mysql --version  # Should be 8.0+
   ```

2. **Setup MySQL Database**:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE restaurant_stock_db;
   CREATE USER 'restaurant_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'restaurant_pass';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON restaurant_stock_db.* TO 'restaurant_user'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

3. **Create GitHub Repository**:

   - Member 1 creates a new repository on GitHub
   - Name it: `restaurant-stock-management`
   - Make it private
   - Add Member 2 and Member 3 as collaborators

4. **Initialize Git** (Member 1 only):

   ```powershell
   cd C:\restaurant-stock-management
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial project setup with models and configuration"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/restaurant-stock-management.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. **Clone Repository** (Member 2 & 3):
   ```powershell
   cd C:\
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/restaurant-stock-management.git
   cd restaurant-stock-management
   ```
